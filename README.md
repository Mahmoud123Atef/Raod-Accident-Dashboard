Creating a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022.

## 🎯Objective:
🌟Clients want to create a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insights on the below requirements :
     👉 Primary KPI's --> Total Casualties & percentages of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle.
     👉 Secondary KPI's --> Total casualties with respect to vehicle type.
     👉 Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current and previous year.
     👉 Maximum casualties by road type.
     👉 Distribution of total casualties by road surface.
     👉 Relation between casualties by area/location & day/night.
	
## 🎯Data gathering & cleaning:
🌟 Imported the excel file and performed activities like removing duplicates, fixing errors, and transforming the data into an easily analysed format. The first step in any data analysis project is to clean the data. Because the raw data we receive consists of errors which might affect the insights drawn.
🌟 There was a misspelling in the column with name [Junction_Control], the misspelled value was (Auto traffic sigl) so i corrected it to (Auto traffic signal).
🌟 Also there was a misspelling in the column with the name [Accident_Severity], the misspelled value was (Fetal) so i corrected it to (Fatal).

## 🎯Data Processing:
🌟 I want to show the trend line for current year and previous year casualties.
🌟 I created a new column and give it a name [Month] to specify the months, i did the same steps for the [Year] column as well.

## 🎯Questions asked:
     👉 Compare the the accident severity, Is it Fatal, Serious or Slight.
     👉 Determine which vehicle type that cuased the most number of casualties?
     👉 Which year has the most number of road casualties?
     👉 What is the road type and road surafce that has the most number of casualties?
     👉 Determine which location that get the most number of casualties and what was light condition?

## 🎯Key insights:
   👉 The most injuries caused by road accidents was slight and not dangerous.
   👉 Cars poses the highest casualties number between all other vehicle types.
   👉 Most accidents took place on the Single carriageway roads and so the most number of casualties.
   👉 Dry surface roads has the most casualties as well.
   👉 Casualties in the urban areas are higher than that in rural areas.

## 🎯Conclusion:
👉 Finally based on the insights, to decrease the number of casualties we can suggest to stakeholders consider the following:
   💊 We should conduct awareness campaigns for car drivers advicing them not to exceed the speed limits in order to reduce the number of accidents.
   💊 We have to talk with the relevant authorities concerned with road safety to improve the conditions of the roads more specially the Single carriageway one.
   💊 Improving roads in urban and rural areas alike, with setting up traffic and guidance signs that help drivers avoid rugged areas and bumps.
